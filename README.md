Select 'START' to begin your first encounter. 

Once you're in battle you'll have a set of commands which you can use to either defeat the deamon or run.

Select 'Attack' to attack and 'Spell' to use a spell.

Watch your health on the right side of the screen, make sure you attack the enemy until their Health Point's (Hp) reach zero to win!

If you're feeling down on luck you can select 'Run' , live another day to tell the tale!
